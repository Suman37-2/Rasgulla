                                        RECIPE

1. First boil the milk over a medium-high heat.
2. Add 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice to the milk.
3. Keep stirring. The milk will begin to curdle. 
4. Turn off the stove when the milk completely curdles. If it doesnot curdle, then add another 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the milk.
5. Then, add ice cold water or ice cubes. This helps to stop the cheese from further cooking and makes it soft.
6. Allow to rest for few minutes.
7. Pour the chhena (cheese) to a bowl with a thin cloth. 
8. Then rinse it with water to remove the lemon flavour.
9. Wrap the chhena with the cloth.
10. Make a knot of the cloth and squeeze the excess water as much as possible.
11. Hang it on a hook for 1-2 hours.
12. Begin to knead it until it turns smooth and uniform.
13. Divide them into small pieces. Make smooth balls which are crack-free.
14. Now to make the syrup, add sugar in a pot.
15. Pour water and put the cardamoms.
16. Dissolve the sugar and boil the water over a medium to medium-high heat.
17. Remove the cardamoms and add some rose water if you want.                             
18. Add balls to the syrup and cover the pot.
